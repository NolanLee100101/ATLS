    <h1>Golf</h1>
    <p>
      I <strong>love to play golf</strong>, my favorite player of all time is Tiger Woods.
      He has won the <a href="https://www.masters.com/index.html">Masters</a> 5 times and a 15 time <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_men%27s_major_championships_winning_golfers">Major Champion!</a>
      He is easily the GOAT of golf.
